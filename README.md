# DyNN

Jupyter notebook containig a brief example on how to use Deep Neural Networks to learn non linear dynamical systems.
The Net is implemented with Keras https://github.com/RiccardoRubini93/DyNN/edit/main/README.md
The folder Data_Lorenz contains the script to generate the dataset.
Play around with the properties of the Net to see how it learns. Have fun!
